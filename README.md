# **Latte Lounge Sales Dashboard Report**

## **Project Background**
Latte Lounge, founded in 2020, began as a small, cozy coffee shop in Texas, USA, with a vision to deliver premium coffee experiences to its customers. Through dedication to quality and a loyal customer base, the company quickly expanded, opening two new locations in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Today, Latte Lounge continues to grow as an international coffee brand, focusing on community, sustainability, and personalized customer experiences.

In line with its mission to strengthen customer relationships and drive business growth, Latte Lounge's Analytics team has undertaken this project to analyze coffee sales data across all locations. The insights derived will enable the development of a rewards system to engage top customers, celebrate the success of high-performing stores, and replicate effective sales strategies across regions.
